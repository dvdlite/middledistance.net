A digital garden is a personal knowledge management system that allows individuals to organize their thoughts, ideas, and notes in a non-linear, interconnected way. It's a digital space where users can create, store, and share information with others. The concept of a digital garden is similar to that of a physical garden, where ideas and knowledge are nurtured and allowed to grow over time.

Digital gardens are typically created using a variety of tools, including note-taking apps, wikis, and personal websites. The content in a digital garden is often presented in a more freeform style than a traditional blog, with links between pages forming a web of interconnected ideas. The idea is to allow users to explore their own thinking and ideas in a flexible and open-ended way, rather than being constrained by a rigid structure or hierarchy.

Digital gardens can be used for a variety of purposes, including personal journaling, idea generation, project management, and collaboration with others. They are a popular tool among writers, bloggers, programmers, and other creatives who need a space to organize their thoughts and research.
