PKM stands for Personal Knowledge Management. It refers to the process of managing, organizing, and making sense of one's own knowledge and information, including both explicit and tacit knowledge.

In essence, PKM is a system for individuals to effectively capture, store, retrieve, and share their own personal knowledge and expertise. This process can involve a variety of tools and strategies, such as note-taking, bookmarking, journaling, and creating a personal knowledge base.

The goal of PKM is to enhance one's ability to learn, adapt, and innovate in their personal and professional lives. By developing a structured approach to managing knowledge, individuals can improve their decision-making, problem-solving, and creativity. Additionally, PKM can help individuals build and maintain their own network of knowledge resources and connections, which can be a valuable asset in today's knowledge-based economy.
