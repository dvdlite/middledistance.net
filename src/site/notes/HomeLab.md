While I have certainly had plenty of servers and devices at home over the years, I had taken a few years off from noodling at home and focused on consumer hardware from Apple, Eero, etc.  Playing with Linux was relegated to [VMware](https://vmware.com) or [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com) virtual machines on my Macs, and I hosted my websites on Linux hosts at [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) and later [AWS Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/).  What little Windows I have played with has been virtualized on my Macs, as well.

Recently, I decided to freshen my technical skills and start focusing more on my professional development.  So I decided to build a HomeLab to use as a learning sandbox as well as stand up services such as [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net) for household use.

I'm adding hardware to my HomeLab opportunistically..  basically grabbing freebie's from friends, buying used devices online, and occasionally splurging for a new component here and there.  So I expect my configuration will evolve over time as I am able to acquire better and interesting things.  My HomeLab is located in my home office, so I plan to try to buy only relatively quiet devices or devices where I can swap in quiet fans.  With that in mind, I don't plan on adding any enterprise-grade servers.

Things are in flux as I've procured some new hardware (including an [[OptiPlex Micro repair\|OptiPlex Micro repair]]) but I haven't incorporated anything new officially into the HomeLab yet. Stay tuned for updates.

Here is the current [[HomeLab config as of 2023-03-19\|HomeLab config as of 2023-03-19]]
