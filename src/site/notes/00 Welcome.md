Welcome to my [[digital garden\|digital garden]], _Into the Middle Distance_. 

The [Urban Dictionary](https://urbandictionary.com) defines “middle distance” as “The place that you can see when you are not quite focusing on the world around you. Often is a blank screen that you can project your own thoughts onto.”  I thought that was fairly profound definition given.. well.. some of the other things you can find defined on that site. 

If you are not familiar with digital gardens, think of them as similar to [[personal knowledge management\|personal knowledge management]] (PKM) systems. But rather than a personal/private repository everything is public. Intentionally public. As in [[learning in public\|learning in public]]. Others have described this as [[working with the garage door open\|working with the garage door open]]. 

As such, you will find this a largely unstructured space. Items are interconnected organically rather than chronologically. My [[10 current focus\|10 current focus]] is subject to change. Many thoughts and topics may be incomplete, inaccurate, or in a draft state. That’s because this space is for me to capture, parse, ponder, and develop my thoughts and projects. 

I hope you, too, are able to find value here. You are welcome to follow along and even offer constructive insights if offered respectfully. Other digital gardeners have compiled a few [[rules of the road\|rules of the road]], which I hope you will bear in mind if you choose to participate. 

There are many ways to navigate this garden.  You can peruse the connection graph, explore the list of topics, or use the search bar if you are curious about a certain topic. Or see below for a few [[guidestones\|guidestones]] to get you started.

Peace, welcome, and enjoy.
