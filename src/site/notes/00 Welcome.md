Welcome to my [[digital garden\|digital garden]], _Into the Middle Distance_. 

The [Urban Dictionary](https://urbandictionary.com) defines “middle distance” as “The place that you can see when you are not quite focusing on the world around you. Often is a blank screen that you can project your own thoughts onto.”  I thought that was fairly profound definition given.. well.. some of the other things you can find defined on that site. 

If you are not familiar with digital gardens, think of them as similar to [[Personal Knowledge Management\|Personal Knowledge Management]] (PKM) systems. But rather than a personal/private repository everything is public. Intentionally public. As in [[Learning in Public\|Learning in Public]]. Others have described this as [[working with the garage door open\|working with the garage door open]]. 

As such, you will find this a largely unstructured space. Items are interconnected organically rather than chronologically. [[05 What I am focusing on at the moment\|05 What I am focusing on at the moment]] is subject to change. Many thoughts and topics may be incomplete, inaccurate, or in a draft state. That’s because this space is for me to capture, parse, ponder, and develop my thoughts and projects. 

I hope you, too, are able to find value here. You are welcome to follow along and even offer constructive insights if offered respectfully. Other digital gardeners have compiled a [[few rules of the road\|few rules of the road]], which I hope you will bear in mind if you choose to participate. 

You can peruse the connection graph below or use the search bar above if you are curious about a certain topic. Or see below for a few guidepost links to get you started. Welcome and enjoy.
